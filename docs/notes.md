Use proj_log to note proj related stuff not features and time only
for example:

## Session 2025-09-11 11:08

- Drafted 3 tasks (11:32)

---

- Talk with ai to guide tacktic and strategy
- Define 3 task and switch beetween if that speeds up stuff

Proj log should be about organizing and time, not features and history
Prompts have details
- Archive old way and start new proj_log file with new way

- Add a task to fix drink counting app
Do app about testing game math
Do app about testing libs

Plan architecture ahead so that SOLID is uphold and after new features refactoring is not needed

Game that learns people how to drive safely
Building game
Garden game
